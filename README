DonSimon 1.0

This is my first project for the Nintendo DS.

It is the famous Simon game and it makes use of the touch screen

The game logic is so simple. It generates a random sequence along the 4 lights, making a different sound on each one, and the player must repeat the same sequence.

Game features:

* Save your records: play with friends and try to win them!
* Great graphics based on the original Simon game.
* Classic Simon sounds.
* Uses the touch screen. Itâ€™s designed to play with your fingers, so you will not need the stylus to play.
* Great effects like zoom and rotations
